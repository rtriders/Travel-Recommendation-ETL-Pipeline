The Travel-Recommendation-ETL-Pipeline is a data processing workflow designed to analyze weather conditions from various global cities and generate insights for travel recommendations. The pipeline evaluates cities based on a Comfort Index, ranking them to help users identify optimal travel destinations.

Key Features:
Data Extraction:

Pulls raw weather data from cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
Weather data includes parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, sea level, and weather conditions.
Data Transformation:

Normalizes weather attributes (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) for standardization.
Computes a Comfort Index for each city using a weighted scoring system:
Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions are scored based on ideal travel conditions.
Generates alerts for extreme conditions, such as high wind warnings, heat advisories, or tsunami warnings.
Ranks cities by their Comfort Index.
Data Loading:

Stores processed data back into the cloud (e.g., AWS S3) as CSV files for downstream applications.
Includes the final output with columns:
City: Name of the city.
Comfort Index: A calculated score representing travel comfort.
Rank: Ranking of cities based on their Comfort Index.

Use Case:
This pipeline is ideal for travel agencies, weather services, or any platform offering travel recommendations. It helps users identify cities with favorable weather conditions for travel while highlighting potential weather-related risks.

Sample Output:
City	Comfort Index	Rank
Sydney	0.87	1
Cape Town	0.85	2
Tokyo	0.82	3
Technical Overview:
Platform: AWS Lambda and S3 for serverless and scalable processing.
Programming Language: Python.
Libraries Used:
pandas for data manipulation.
boto3 for AWS integration.
How It Works:
ETL Process:

Extract: Fetch raw weather data from S3.
Transform: Process and normalize data, compute Comfort Index, and rank cities.
Load: Save the ranked cities back to S3.
Alert System:

Flags extreme weather conditions like heatwaves or high wind speeds, enabling users to make informed decisions.
Ranking System:

Cities are ranked based on their Comfort Index, with higher scores indicating better travel conditions.
